# Scanning-Github-Repos
Here i am using my github repositories
The code uses GitHub to fetcg the repos from the user id
and then we loop through each repo to scan it
We use GitPython to scan the repo
Making a clone of the repo and storing it in temporary directory using clone_from fucntion of GitPython
Look for the recent commits made to the repo and find for the difference between recent commits.
